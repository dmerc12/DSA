# Data Structures Notes:

## Data Structure Definition:
A data storage format.
It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection, as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the data structure.

## Operations on Data Structures:
- Access and read values.
- Search for arbitrary values.
- Insert values at any point into the structure.
- Delete values in the structure.

## Data Structure Types:
- Arrays: Stores a collection of values that are accessed using an index or key. Used as building blocks to create other data structures.
- Linked List: Each element or objectt in a linked list is a node that contains the data and a pointer to the previous and / or next node(s). Contains a head and tail node for the start and end of the list.
